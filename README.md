## Lotka-Volterra-Model:
Lotka-Volterra equations: predator-prey model

Isolated ecosystem: no migration, no other species present, no pests...

The prey population in the absence of predators grows exponentially: the rate of reproduction is proportional to the number of individuals. Prey only die when they are killed by the predator

The predator population in the absence of prey decreases exponentially.

The predator population affects the prey population by decreasing it proportionally to the number of prey and predators.

Prey population affects predator population also proportionally to the number of encounters, but with different proportionality constant

Lions and zebras

# A system of two first-order, coupled, autonomous, non-linear, coupled first-order differential equations

dx/dt = ax - bxy

dy/dt = - cy + dyx


# Parameters:

x = nº prey (zebras)

y = nº predator (lions)

a = growth rate of prey

b = success in predator hunting

c = rate of decrease of predators

d = hunting success and how much a predator is fed by hunting prey
